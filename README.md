### Machine Learning for IoT: Enhancing Physical Therapy with Sensor Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning to improve outcomes in physical therapy. By analyzing sensor data from IoT devices, I have developed three models: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection). These models classify physical therapy exercises, predict patient progress, and detect anomalies in movement.

## Models Overview

**CNN Model:** classifies types of physical therapy exercises by processing multi-dimensional time-series data from wearable sensors.

**LSTM Model:** predicts future sensor readings, which can help anticipate patient progress and tailor therapy programs.

**Isolation Forest Model:** identifies outliers in sensor data, potentially flagging incorrect exercise execution or irregular movements.

## Dataset
I used time-series data from wearable MTx sensors equipped with accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. This comprehensive dataset captured the nuances of various physical therapy exercises.

## Results and Insights
My models showed promising results in classifying exercises and providing actionable insights. The CNN improved in accuracy over training epochs, the LSTM showed potential in predicting patient progress, and the Isolation Forest effectively identified outliers.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the synergy between IoT and healthcare, underlining the importance of leveraging machine learning to interpret complex sensor data. My three-model approach serves as a solid foundation for advancing physical therapy practices, with the potential to enhance patient care through a data-driven dashboard.
