**Machine Learning for IoT: Physical Therapy Exercise Classification and Prediction**

**Project Overview**

This project leverages machine learning to enhance physical therapy through two main approaches: classifying types of physical therapy exercises from sensor data using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, and predicting future sensor readings with a time series prediction model.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset used in this project contains rich time-series data captured from wearable MTx sensor units, each housing tri-axial accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. The data encapsulate various physical therapy exercises performed by subjects, allowing the models to learn and recognize patterns in exercise execution.

**Models**

**1. Physical Therapy Exercise Classifier**

The first component of the project is a CNN model designed to classify the type of physical therapy exercise being performed. It processes the multi-dimensional sensor data, capturing the intricate motion patterns that characterize each exercise type.

**Data Preprocessing**
Segmentation: The sensor data were divided into uniform segments to form the input for the CNN, with padding for shorter segments and truncation for longer ones to maintain consistency.
Normalization: The sensor data were normalized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, aiding in the model's convergence and performance.
CNN Architecture
The CNN architecture is composed of convolutional layers for feature extraction, max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and dense layers for classification. The output layer uses softmax activation to provide a probability distribution over the exercise types.

**Training and Validation**
The model was trained on 60% of the data, validated on 20%, and tested on the remaining 20%. It was evaluated based on accuracy, with plans to include a comprehensive analysis of precision, recall, and F1 scores for detailed performance metrics.

**2. Time Series Prediction Model**

The second model in this project focuses on predicting future sensor readings based on historical data. Using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) known for its effectiveness in sequential data, the model aims to forecast the sensor data for subsequent time steps.

**LSTM Model Setup**
Data Structuring: The LSTM model requires data in a sequence format, where each input sequence is used to predict the next value in the time series.
Feature Engineering: The time series data were processed to extract meaningful features and structure them into sequences that serve as inputs to the LSTM network.
LSTM Architecture
The LSTM model comprises LSTM layers that process the input sequences, followed by dense layers that output the predicted future sensor readings.

**Training and Evaluation**
The LSTM model was trained to minimize the mean squared error between its predictions and the actual future sensor readings. Evaluation involved assessing the model's ability to accurately forecast unseen data, measuring performance with metrics suitable for regression tasks, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

**Results and Insights**

The CNN classifier demonstrated a promising ability to differentiate between exercise types with an accuracy that improved across training epochs, suggesting that the model was learning meaningful patterns from the sensor data.
The LSTM predictor offered valuable forecasts of future sensor readings, with performance indicating the model's potential as a predictive tool in physical therapy settings.
Future Directions

**Model Optimization:** 

Both models will undergo further tuning, including hyperparameter optimization, regularization, and potentially exploring alternative architectures to enhance performance.
Cross-Validation: Implementing k-fold cross-validation to ensure model stability and reliability across various data subsets.
Advanced Feature Engineering: Exploring more sophisticated time-series feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy and robustness.
Model Interpretability: Investigating model decisions for both classifiers and predictors to gain insights into the factors driving predictions and classifications.

**Conclusion**

This project stands at the intersection of IoT, machine learning, and healthcare, demonstrating the power of advanced analytical techniques to interpret sensor data and predict outcomes. The dual-model approach caters to both immediate classification needs and future event prediction, showcasing a comprehensive application of machine learning in a real-world context.
